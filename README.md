# Simulated Airline Webapp

## About
An project created using the PHP CodeIgniter framework to test MVC concepts in PHP. 
This project simulates an online airplane booking service, complete with models of flights, airplanes (the fleet), and airports.
The webapp leverages a backend with multiple endpoints able to return flight data in various formats, and allows user interaction from
the frontend to determine when flights are leaving and departing

## Admin
By logging in as an admin, a user is able to modify elements in the model. Airplane and flight data can be modified, with changes reflected in real time.

## Background
This project was created as part of the COMP4711 course at BCIT, over the course of four or so weeks, by a team of two people.
